I couldn't have accomplished anything by standing still, without anybody's help. I treasure every moment I have spent here. Unlucky? I feel pretty lucky. This is my resolve.", author: "Sawada Tsunayoshi" },

Although if you can endure that pain and walk away from it, you'll find that you now have a heart strong enough to overcome any obstacle... Yeah... A Fullmetal Heart.", author: "Edward Elric" }
